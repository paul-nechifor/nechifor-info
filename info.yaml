    Hello, I’m a passionate developer and engineer from Iași, Romania.

    I’ve been writing side projects since I’ve started programming.

    I’m a fast learner and I like to take on challenging projects with other
    experienced programmers to further develop my skills and leave behind
    beautiful projects.

    I believe good code can be written in any language. I have an eye out for
    detail and precision in everything I do.

    Things I’ve done in the past and liked and would be interested in exploring
    further. If you’re interested in something similar (big co and startup
    alike) go ahead and contact me.

    - **Network communication protocols**

    - **3D graphics on the web**: use of WebGL for extending the possibilities
    of meaningful web communication (not gimmicky stuff) like mapping, analysis
    tools, more immersive previews than simple photos.

    - **Digital publishing with good typography**: publication of content that
    builds and improves on classic typography. Much of current publishing is
    subpar to dead tree typography.

    - **Natural language correction tools**: practical (web?) NLP tools that
    correct text beyond simple spell checkers.

    - **Clear designs**: unobtrusive design that focuses on the content and its
    navigation and manipulation.

    - **AI game algorithms**: From complex algorithms for simple pen and paper
    games to writing bots for complex games.

    - **Programming languages**: I don’t think enough languages exist.
    There is room for improvement especially in non-general purpose languages.
