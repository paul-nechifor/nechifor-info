    short: Hi.
    long: >
      Hello, I’m a passionate developer and engineer from Iași, Romania. I’ve
      been writing side projects since I’ve started programming. I’m a fast
      learner and I like to take on challenging projects with other experienced
      programmers to further develop my skills and leave behind beautiful
      projects. I believe good code can be written in any language. I have an
      eye out for detail and precision in everything I do. See my programming
      [showreel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZZW-KqOmOE) draft.
